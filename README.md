#### What is Cardtorium?

- Cardtorium is a turn-based 2D card civilization game inspired by Clash Royale, Card Wars, and Polytopia. It's designed to be a **local multiplayer** pass-and-play game that allows users to build a deck and enter a game to capture their opponent's base. Check out the website for more information: [Cardtorium](https://open-source-software-development.github.io/Cardtorium-Website/#/index).

#### Gameplay

- You will strategically build a deck of cards before beginning the game. Starting out, you can place cards from your hand onto your base. Once a card is placed, it cannot be moved until your next turn. 
- Once you move your troops and clear the fog of war, you'll be able to see more of your opponent's strategy!
- Capture your opponent's base to win.
  
#### Gameplay Control
To move the map, use the arrow keys, WASD, or click and drag the screen.
- On each turn, you can click each troop and move/attack/take action. 
- Claim territory: your troop must not be currently on the edge of your territory. Click "Claim"
- Attack: select your troop to attack with, then click on the opponent's troop that is in range
- End turn: When you are satisfied with your troop's configuration and finished actions, click to end your turn.

#### Implementation
This game is created with Godot, written with GDScript.
